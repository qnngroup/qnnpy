Welcome to qnnpy's documentation!
=================================

``qnnpy`` is a python-based instrument control toolbox for the
Quantum Nanostructure and Nanofabrication Group (QNN) at MIT.
The primary goal of this package is to simplify and standardize the measurement of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) and other superconducting nanoelectronics.
This package is split into two main submodules: ``functions``, and ``instruments``.

This reposotory does not contain commands that will perform your measurements for you.
Its purpose is to organize, standardize, and improve the existing programming infrastructure.

.. note::
   This project is under active development and the API is subject to change.
